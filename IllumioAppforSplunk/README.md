# OVERVIEW
 
* The Illumio App for Splunk integrates with the Illumio Policy Compute Engine (PCE) to provide security and operational insights into your Illumio secured data center. A dashboard view displays an overview of the security posture of the data center. 
* With improved visibility of east-west traffic, Security Operations Center (SOC) staff can detect unauthorized activity and potential attacks from traffic blocked by Illumio segmentation policy on workloads in "Enforcement" mode. Additionally, the Illumio App for Splunk provides visibility into potentially blocked traffic for workloads in "Test" mode. SOC staff can quickly pinpoint potential attacks and identify workloads with a significant number of blocked flows.
* For CIM support, please install the Illumio Technology Add-On (TA) for Splunk available at https://splunkbase.splunk.com
* Version: 3.2.1
* Supported Splunk versions are 8.1.x and 8.2.x

# RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

* Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head.

# TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

* This app has been distributed in two parts.

    1) Add-on app, which listens for Syslog messages from Illumio PCE and collects Illumio metadata using REST API Calls.
    
    2) The main app for visualizing Illumio PCE data.

* This App can be set up in two ways:

  1) __Standalone Mode__:
  
Install the main app and Add-on app.

* Here both the app resides on a single machine.
* The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it.

  2) __Distributed Environment__: 
  
    a) With heavy forwarder

    Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on heavy forwarder.
        
    * Configure Add-on app on heavy forwarder.
    * The main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.
            
    b) With Splunk Universal Forwarder

    Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on universal forwarder and indexer.
 
    1. Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect data from Illumio Server.
        * Create TCP stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
            ```
            [tcp://<PORT>]
            index=<INDEX-NAME>
            sourcetype=illumio:pce
            ```              
    2. Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder to send the data to Splunk Indexer.
        * Execute below command on SUF.
     	    * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forwardÂ­server <IP>:<PORT> (Splunk Indexer IP and Listening Port)

    3. Configure Splunk Indexer to receive data from SUF.
        * Create below stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
            ```
            [splunktcp://<PORT>]
            ```

# INSTALLATION IN SPLUNK CLOUD

* Same as on-premise setup.

# INSTALLATION OF APP

* This app can be installed through UI using "Manage Apps" or from the command line using the following command:
    ```sh
    $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk install app $PATH_TO_SPL/IllumioAppforSplunk.spl/
    ```
* User can directly extract SPL file into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.

# DATA MODEL
* The app consist of one data model "Illumio". The acceleration for the data model is disabled by default. If you want to improve the performance of dashboards then enable the data model acceleration.
* The accelerated data models help in improving the performance of the dashboard but it increases the disk usage on the indexer.

# DATA MODEL CONFIGURATION
* The Data Model used in this application is not accelerated. Admin should manually accelerate the Data Model.
* The Data Model used in this application should be accelerated with 1 week's period. Admin can enable/disable acceleration or change the acceleration period by the following steps:
    * On Splunkâs menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models
    * From the list for Data models, click âEditâ in the "Action" column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be enabled or disabled.
    * From the list of actions select Edit Acceleration. This will display the pop-up menu for Edit Acceleration.
    * Check or uncheck Accelerate checkbox to "Enable" or "Disable" data model acceleration respectively.
    * If acceleration is enabled, select the summary range to specify acceleration period.
    * To save acceleration changes click on save button.

# REBUILDING DATA MODEL
* In case there is no need to use the already indexed accelerated Data Model, the Data Model can be configured to rebuild from scratch for the specified acceleration period. Data Model can be rebuilt by the following steps:
    * On Splunkâs menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models.
    * From the list for Data models, expand the row by clicking â>" arrow in the first column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be rebuild. This will display an extra Data Model information in "Acceleration" section.
    * From the "Acceleration" section click on "Rebuild" link.
    * Monitor the status of "Rebuild" in the field "Status" of "Acceleration" section. Reload the page to get latest rebuild status.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

* If dashboards are not getting populated:
    * Check "illumio_get_index" macro is updated if, you are using the custom index.
    * Check if the data model is accelerated or not.
    * Make sure you have data in given time range.
    * To check data is collected or not, run " `illumio_get_index` | stats count by sourcetype" query in the search.
    * Try expanding TimeRange.
    * Try "<instance_url>/<language>/_bump" endpoint to clear cache and load new static content.
* If sankey diagram is not visualize in Traffic Explorer dashboard's "Communications Map between Labeled Workloads" panel:
    * Be aware that you will need to install the Sankey Diagram App from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/
* If the user wants to summarize port scan data to some custom index then update the "illumio_portscan_index" macro as mentioned below:
    *  index = <your_index>
* If label filters (i.e. app, env and loc) are not populated:
    * Try to run the "Illumio_Workload_Mapping" saved search via expanding timerange.
    * Make sure that interval configuration for input is less than 24 hours.
